    <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>

    <p> I am 24 years old and I was born in Dallas, Texas, where I am hoping to move from soon since I have been here all my life.</p>

    <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Health Care Administration and afterward went to nursing school but then realized it was not for me. :(.</p>

    <p>I ended up reading about tech and became curious about the #techlife so I went through a rabbithole and stumbled upon this program. I am hoping to be able to succeed in this program to start a career where I have room to grow, learn, and be successful!</p>
